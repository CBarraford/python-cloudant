python-cloudant
===============
A python module for interacting with Cloudant. (**Unusable**)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CBarraford/python-cloudant.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CBarraford/python-cloudant)

Goal
====
I'm writing this as a means to teach myself the cloudant product. I feel its a good way to learn the service is writing an easy to use wrapper for it.

Requirements
============
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html)

Tests
=====
python-cloudant is written in a test-driven development mentality. All methods and code must have an associated test written for it. To run these tests, execute
```
    python test.py -v
```
Travis CI is used to run tests on all push and pull requests.
